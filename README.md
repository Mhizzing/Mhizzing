Hi, I’m @Mhizzing.

This place is hopefully going to turn into what I will be able to one day call my 'virtual lab', a place for lots of fun experimentation and such. I love programming, but barely have any free time to play around with personal projects what with work and life, so we shall see if I can make anything out of this!

If you want to get in touch, you can find on Discord at Mhizzing#0002. :D
