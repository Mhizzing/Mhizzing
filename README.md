Hi, I’m @Mhizzing.

This place is hopefully going to turn into what I will be able to one day call my 'virtual lab', a place for lots of fun experimentation, learning and such. I love programming, but barely have any free time to play around with personal projects what with work and life, so we shall see if I can make anything out of this!
